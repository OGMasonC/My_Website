<h1>Who is Mason Chen</h1>
<p>My name is Mason Chen. I am a current <em>Master of Financial Analysis</em> student at <strong>London Business School</strong>. I have a very strong passion for finance and that is why I choose to study <strong>Finance</strong> as my major in both undergraduates and masters. I also finished CFA level 2 this year.</p>
<p>Aside from my academic credentials, I have a well-rounded but little bit untraditional work experience and acquired many transferable skills that are relevant to the investment banking analyst position. As a financial advisor in Canadian imperial banks of Commerce, I established a client base of 90 client with over $8 million CAD AUM through deal souring and client-relationship management. I am also responsible in advising businesses in their credit, debt and cash flow needs. It is during that time when I found my interest in <strong>corporate finance</strong>.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I also worked as commercial real estate analyst in a boutique brokerage. I participated on many assembling and restructuring deals where I performed valuation analysis, detailed market research and extensive l due diligence. I enjoyed the <em>fast and deal</em> oriented work environment.</p>
<p>Apart from my work, I am also a professional weightlifter and I have won the 2nd place in BC powerlifting competition. I love <del>intensity</del> very much and embrace challenges and pushing to the absolute limit.</p>
<p>Later on, I find that <strong>investment banking</strong> would be the perfect combination of the exciting components: corporate finance, deal oriented, fast challenging and intellectually rewarding.</p>
