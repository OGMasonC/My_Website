# Who is Mason Chen
My name is Mason Chen. I am a current *Master of Financial Analysis* student at **London Business School**. I have a very strong passion for finance and that is why I choose to study **Finance** as my major in both undergraduates and masters. I also finished CFA level 2 this year. 

Aside from my academic credentials, I have a well-rounded but little bit untraditional work experience and acquired many transferable skills that are relevant to the investment banking analyst position. As a financial advisor in Canadian imperial banks of Commerce, I established a client base of 90 client with over $8 million CAD AUM through deal souring and client-relationship management. I am also responsible in advising businesses in their credit, debt and cash flow needs. It is during that time when I found my interest in **corporate finance**. 

Prior to that, I also worked as commercial real estate analyst in a boutique brokerage. I participated on many assembling and restructuring deals where I performed valuation analysis, detailed market research and extensive l due diligence. I enjoyed the *fast and deal* oriented work environment.

Apart from my work, I am also a professional weightlifter and I have won the 2nd place in BC powerlifting competition. I love ~~intensity~~ very much and embrace challenges and pushing to the absolute limit.

Later on, I find that **investment banking** would be the perfect combination of the exciting components:  corporate finance, deal oriented, fast challenging and intellectually rewarding.
