# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
Biden_Approval_Margins <- read_csv(here::here("data","approval_polllist.csv"))

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)
```


```{r, cache=TRUE}
approval_weeks <- approval_polllist %>%
          mutate(week=week(mdy(enddate))-3) %>%
          group_by(week) %>%
          select(!enddate) %>%
          select(!startdate) %>%
          mutate(net_approval= approve - disapprove)%>%
          select(!approve)%>%
          select(!disapprove)%>%
          select(!multiversions) %>%
          select(!tracking)%>%
          select(!adjusted_approve)%>%
          select(!adjusted_disapprove)%>%
          select(!timestamp)

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.
Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:


```{r}
formula_ci_approval <- approval_weeks %>% 
  
  group_by(week) %>% 

  summarise(count = n(),
            mean = mean(net_approval,na.rm=TRUE),
            SD = sd(net_approval,na.rm=TRUE),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            SE = SD/sqrt(count),
            margin_error= t_critical*SE,
            lower = (mean - margin_error),
            upper =(mean + margin_error))

formula_ci_approval
```

```{r}
formula_ci_approval %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y=mean))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y=upper), color = "red", size=0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y=lower), color = "red", size=0.3)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),fill="grey", alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+
  geom_line(y=0,color = "orange", size=2)+
  labs(
    title= "Approval Margin for Joe Biden ",
    x= "Weeks",
    y= "Net average approval margins "
  )



```

## Compare Confidence Intervals 

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 4` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.
>The CI for week 4 (in our document, recoded to week 1) is [10.42 - 19.29] while the CI for week 25 (in our document, recoded to week 21) is [7.82-11.53]. The first thing that becomes clear is that the width of the CI is different for week 1 (8.87) and 25  (3.71). The reason for this relies in the sample size of the polls: in week 1 there only were 20 polls providing data,against the 46 polls for week 25. The sample of the size influences the CIs also by affecting the SE: as we can see from the table above (formula_ci_approval) the SE week 1 is much higher than for for week 25 (2.119 vs 0.922).
